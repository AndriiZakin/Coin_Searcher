24.01 -> finished the main parts of the simulator 
- for tommorow I will have to handle some problems in the coin_simulator.py
- the issue is that the function has unnecesary statement if else
25.01 -> finished the basics with simulations, may be improved if needed we will se it later. Now try to impove the find_coins and add part like list new added coins or etc. 
- for tommorow I have to finish the fin_coins and think about any improvement. Consider the thing that the coin just grow by 5200% which is insane, can try to do something with it.
- check for any issues(add more tests) and add readme file
- think about incapsulation and etc.
