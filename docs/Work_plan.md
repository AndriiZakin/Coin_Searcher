24.01 -> finished the main parts of the simulator 
- for tommorow I will have to handle some problems in the coin_simulator.py
- the issue is that the function has unnecesary statement if else
25.01 ->finished the basics with simulations, may be improved if needed we will se it later. Now try to impove the find_coins and add part like list new added coins or etc.
- started from the main.py insted of find_coins( well i added init but that's all)
- write tests
- I kind of added a CI but needs to be improved
